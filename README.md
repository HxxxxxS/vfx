Music visualizer. Stoner TV. Dance floor backdrop.

Two layers of hand picked YouTube videos. They are mixed using various CSS3 blend modes. Another layer adding occasional glitch effects. By tapping space/T you can set the animation tempo (or by typing a bpm with your number keys). Clicking mouse1 sets the beginning of a bar/animation cycle.

Hacked together for a TV screen at a house party with a friend DJ-ing. Extended multiple times since.
